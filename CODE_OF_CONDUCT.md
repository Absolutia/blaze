# Code of Conduct
So you've decided to join us? Cool, sit right down and memorize this here list...
#### Do:
* Write code. Duh! That's why you're here...
* Discuss design changes, because it will never be perfect.
* Request features. We could always use more functionality.
* Report bugs, so broken stuff can be fixed.
* Explain criticisms, rather than just stating them.
* ***Stay on topic.*** I can't repeat that enough.
#### Don't:
* Be cryptic, insulting or an annoying spammer.
* Submit malware, unsolicited links, or people's personal information.
* Hijack conversations away from the project!
* Ask for collaborator status.
## A disclaimer
***The project maintainers reserve the right to take enforcement action for any other reason.***<br><br>
This is because ones' interpretation of these rules are somewhat subjective. What they mean to us are certainly somewhat different than what they mean to you.
If you're unsure if it's allowed, please DM a maintainer.
