# Contribution guidelines
## Code style
* A single source file may not contain more than 7 to 10 functions, struct, union or enum definitions nor may it exceed 300 lines maximum.
  * Code compactness is always preferred except where it comes at the expense of clarity.
* Commas are always followed by a space and operators are always surrounded by spaces.
  * eg `call(x, y, z);` instead of `call(x,y,z);` and `var += 5;` instead of `var+=5;`.
